      [Dataset Description]:

      This dataset contains hourly averaged sensor data from an air quality monitoring device in an Italian city, used to predict pollution indicators.

      "Date": date, the calendar date of measurement (format: DD/MM/YYYY)

      "Time": categorical, the time of measurement (format: HH.MM.SS)

      "CO(GT)": integer, true hourly averaged concentration of carbon monoxide in mg/m^3

      "PT08.S1(CO)": categorical, sensor response (nominally CO targeted)

      "NMHC(GT)": integer, true hourly averaged concentration of non-methane hydrocarbons in microg/m^3

      "C6H6(GT)": continuous, true hourly averaged concentration of benzene in microg/m^3

      "PT08.S2(NMHC)": categorical, sensor response (nominally NMHC targeted)

      "NOx(GT)": integer, true hourly averaged concentration of NOx in ppb

      "PT08.S3(NOx)": categorical, sensor response (nominally NOx targeted)

      "NO2(GT)": integer, true hourly averaged concentration of NO2 in microg/m^3

      "PT08.S4(NO2)": categorical, sensor response (nominally NO2 targeted)

      "PT08.S5(O3)": categorical, sensor response (nominally O3 targeted)

      "T": continuous, temperature in Celsius

      "RH": continuous, relative humidity in percentage

      "AH": continuous, absolute humidity

      You can access the entire dataset via the "data" variable.
