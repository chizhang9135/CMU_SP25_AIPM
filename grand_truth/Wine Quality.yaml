  content: '[Dataset Description]:

    This dataset contains physicochemical and sensory data of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wines, both red and white variants, collected to predict wine quality scores.

    "fixed_acidity": continuous, measures the tartaric acid concentration, impacting wine stability and taste

    "volatile_acidity": continuous, indicates the amount of acetic acid in the wine, which at high levels can lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste

    "citric_acid": continuous, contributes freshness and flavor; present in small quantities

    "residual_sugar": continuous, the amount of sugar left after fermentation; typically <4g/L but can vary

    "chlorides": continuous, amount of salt in wine, affecting taste and preservation

    "free_sulfur_dioxide": continuous, the SO₂ that prevents microbial growth and oxidation

    "total_sulfur_dioxide": continuous, total amount of SO₂ including bound and free forms

    "density": continuous, related to the alcohol and sugar content of the wine

    "pH": continuous, the inverse measure of acidity; affects flavor and preservation

    "sulphates": continuous, additive contributing to microbial stability and wine flavor

    "alcohol": continuous, percentage of ethanol; higher alcohol often correlates with higher quality

    "quality": integer, sensory quality score assigned by human testers (0–10 scale)

    "color": categorical, specifies whether the wine sample is red or white

    You can access the entire dataset via the "data" variable.'
