  content: '[Dataset Description]:

    This dataset contains physicochemical and sensory variables related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The goal is to model wine quality based on these variables.


    "fixed_acidity": float, the fixed acidity of the wine measured in grams per liter

    "volatile_acidity": float, the volatile acidity of the wine measured in grams per liter

    "citric_acid": float, the citric acid content of the wine measured in grams per liter

    "residual_sugar": float, the residual sugar content of the wine measured in grams per liter

    "chlorides": float, the chlorides content of the wine measured in grams per liter

    "free_sulfur_dioxide": float, the free sulfur dioxide content of the wine measured in milligrams per liter

    "total_sulfur_dioxide": float, the total sulfur dioxide content of the wine measured in milligrams per liter

    "density": float, the density of the wine measured in grams per cubic centimeter

    "pH": float, the pH level of the wine

    "sulphates": float, the sulphates content of the wine measured in grams per liter

    "alcohol": float, the alcohol content of the wine measured in percentage

    "quality": integer, the quality score of the wine ranging from 0 to 10

    "color": categorical, indicates the type of wine, either "red" or "white"
