  content: '[Dataset Description]:

    This dataset contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located in a significantly polluted area at road level within an Italian city, recording data on various air quality metrics.


    "Date": date, the date of the recorded measurements in DD/MM/YYYY format

    "Time": categorical, the time of day when the measurements were taken in HH.MM.SS format

    "CO(GT)": integer, true hourly averaged concentration of CO in mg/m^3 (reference analyzer)

    "PT08.S1(CO)": categorical, hourly averaged sensor response nominally targeted at CO

    "NMHC(GT)": integer, true hourly averaged overall Non-Methanic Hydrocarbons concentration in microg/m^3 (reference analyzer)

    "C6H6(GT)": continuous, true hourly averaged Benzene concentration in microg/m^3 (reference analyzer)

    "PT08.S2(NMHC)": categorical, hourly averaged sensor response nominally targeted at NMHC

    "NOx(GT)": integer, true hourly averaged NOx concentration in ppb (reference analyzer)

    "PT08.S3(NOx)": categorical, hourly averaged sensor response nominally targeted at NOx

    "NO2(GT)": integer, true hourly averaged NO2 concentration in microg/m^3 (reference analyzer)

    "PT08.S4(NO2)": categorical, hourly averaged sensor response nominally targeted at NO2

    "PT08.S5(O3)": categorical, hourly averaged sensor response nominally targeted at O3

    "T": continuous, temperature in degrees Celsius

    "RH": continuous, relative humidity in percentage

    "AH": continuous, absolute humidity
