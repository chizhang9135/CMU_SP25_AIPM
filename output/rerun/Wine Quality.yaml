WineQuality:
- role: system
  content: '[Dataset Description]:

    This dataset contains information about the quality of red and white variants

    of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine, based on physicochemical tests and sensory

    evaluations. The goal is to model wine quality using these variables.


    "fixed_acidity": float, the fixed acidity of the wine measured in grams per liter


    "volatile_acidity": float, the volatile acidity of the wine measured in grams

    per liter


    "citric_acid": float, the citric acid content of the wine measured in grams per

    liter


    "residual_sugar": float, the residual sugar content of the wine measured in grams

    per liter


    "chloride_content": float, the chloride concentration in the wine measured in grams

    per liter


    "free_sulfur_dioxide": float, the free sulfur dioxide content of the wine measured

    in milligrams per liter


    "total_sulfur_dioxide": float, the total sulfur dioxide content of the wine measured

    in milligrams per liter


    "wine_density": float, the density of the wine measured in grams per cubic centimeter


    "pH": float, the pH level of the wine


    "sulphate_content": float, the sulphate concentration in the wine measured in grams

    per liter


    "alcohol_content": float, the alcohol percentage of the wine


    "quality_score": integer, the quality score of the wine ranging from 0 to 10


    "color": categorical, indicates the type of wine, either "red" or "white"
